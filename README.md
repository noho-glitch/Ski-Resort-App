# Overview

We created an interactive app for skiiers to use who want to search local resorts and check current weather conditions.

# How to Use

Users enter zip code into the search input. Results within a 25 mile radius will be populated as cards containing ski resort name, address, phone number, and a picture from Yelp. The user can click the "Get Weather" button to see the current weather conditions at the corresponding resort.
